        <h2>Object methods, "this"</h2>


        <a href="https://javascript.info/object-methods">JavaScript Info</a></li>
        <p> Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on
            And, in the real world, a user can act: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.
            METHOD SHORTHAND
            <img src="images/methodshorthand.png" alt="method shorthand">

            <p>To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.
                The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.</p>


            <h5>Example below</h5><br>



            <p>let user = {<br>
                name: "John",<br>
                age: 30,<br>

                sayHi() {<br>
                // "this" is the "current object"<br>
                alert(this.name);<br>
                }<br>

                };<br>

                user.sayHi(); // John</p><br>



            <p>>In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the
                method
                was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.</p>

            <h3> Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> • Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
                <li> • Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
                <li>• Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
                <li>• The value of this is defined at run-time.</li>
                <li> • When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is
                    called.</li>
                <li> • A function can be copied between objects.</li>
                <li> • When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the
                    call is object.</li><br>
                <p> Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an
                    arrow function, it is taken from outside.</p>
            </ul>
            <h2> Sitepoint</h2>
            <h1>Ch5 OBJECTS</h1>

            <p>“Everything in JavaScript is either one of the six primitive data types we met in Chapter 2 (strings,
                numbers, booleans, symbols, undefined, and null) or an object”
                Objects are: arrays, functions, Object literals, Adding properties to objects, Object methods, JSON,
                Math object, Date object, RegExp object
            </p>
            <p>Objects are: arrays, functions, Object literals, Adding properties to objects, Object methods, JSON, Math
                object,
                Date object, RegExp object</p><br>

            <h2>Object Literals</h2>
            <p>Object: self-contained set of related values and functions. If a property’s value is a function, it in a
                method.
                : Objects are often used to keep any related information and functionality together in the same place.
                For example, if you wrote functions that found the perimeter and area of a square, you might want to
                group them together as methods of the same object that also included a length property.”
                OBJECT LITERAL: an object created by wrapping all properties and methods in curly braces {}</p><br>
            <p>Example from book<br>
                const superman = {<br>
                name: 'Superman',<br>
                'real name': 'Clark Kent',<br>
                height: 75,<br>
                weight: 235,<br>
                hero: true,<br>
                villain: false,<br>
                allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],<br>
                fly() {<br>
                return 'Up, up and away!';<br>
                }<br>
                };<br>
                CREATING OBJECTS: “To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. The following
                example creates an empty object that is assigned to the variable spiderman :<br>
                const spiderman = {};<br>
                shorthand:<br>
                const name = 'Iron Man';<br>
                const realName = 'Tony Stark';<br>
                // long way<br>
                const ironMan = { name: name, realName: realName };<br>
                // short ES6 way<br>
                const ironMan = { name, realName };<br>
                ACCESSING PROPERTIES: use dot notation ex superman.name or use brackets superman[‘name’]<br>
                To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation. Calling a method is the same as
                invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name:superman.fly()<br>
                <p>
                    << 'Up, up and away!' <br>
                        superman['fly']()<br>
                        << 'Up, up and away!' <br>
                            In operator checks to see if an operator has a particular property. <br>
                            ‘city’ in superman;<br>
                            <<false<br>
                                Superman.city !== undefined;<br>
                                <<false<br>
                                    .hasOwnProperty(); will show what belongs to a particular object<br>
                </p>

                <h5>To find all the properties of an object use a for in loop</h5>

                <p>To add a property superman.city = ‘Metropolis’; ((Metropolis (this adds to the list)<br>
                    To change a property just assign it to the value of an object = superman[‘rel name’] = ‘Kal-El’;
                    <<Kal-El<br>
                        To remove an object use the delte operator ; delete superman.fly (true)</p><br>
                <h3>OBJECTS CAN CONTAIN OTHER OBJECTS</h3>
                <p> Nested objects:<br>
                    const jla = {<br>
                    superman: { realName: 'Clark Kent' },<br>
                    batman: { realName: 'Bruce Wayne' },<br>
                    wonderWoman: { realName: 'Diana Prince" },<br>
                    flash: { realName: 'Barry Allen' },<br>
                    aquaman: { realName: 'Arthur Curry' },<br>
                    }
                    The values in nested objects can be accessed by referencing each property name in order using either
                    dot or bracket notation:
                    jla.wonderWoman.realName<br>
                    << "Diana Prince" <br>
                        jla['flash']['realName']<br>
                        << "Barry Allen" <br>
                            You can even mix the different notations:<br>
                            jla.aquaman['realName']<br>
                            << "Arthur Curry" <br>
                </p>
                <h2>this</h2>
                <p> “the keyword this refers to the object that it is within. It can be used inside methods to gain
                    access to the object’s properties.”</p>
                <h3>JSON</h3>
                <p>“JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen. There are,
                    however, a couple of key differences:</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li> 1. Property names must be double-quoted</li>
                    <li>2. Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and objects
                    </li>
                    <li> 3. Functions are not permitted values</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>JSON.parse and Json.stringify</h5>

                <h2>Math Object</h2>

                    <p>const today = new Date();<br>
                        The variable today now points to a Date object. To see what the date is, we use the toString()
                        method that all objects have:<br>
                        today.toString();<br>
                        << 'Tue Feb 14 2017 16:35:18 GMT+0000 (GMT)' <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>• Objects are a collection of key-value pairs placed inside curly braces {}. </li>
                        <li>• Objects have properties that can be any JavaScript value. If it’s a function, it’s known
                            as amethod.</li>
                        <li>• An object’s properties and methods can be accessed using either dot notation or square
                            bracket notation.</li>
                        <li>• Objects are mutable, which means their properties and methods can be changed or removed.
                        </li>
                        <li>• Objects can be used as parameters to functions, which allows arguments to be entered in
                            any order, or omitted.</li>
                        <li>• Nested objects can be created by placing objects inside objects.</li>
                        <li>• JSON is a portable data format that uses JavaScript object literals to exchange
                            information.</li>
                        <li>• The Math object gives access to a number of mathematical constants.</li>
                        <li>• The Math object can be used to perform mathematical calculations.</li>
                        <li>• The Date object can be used to create date objects.</li>
                        <li>• Once you’ve created a Date object, you can use the getter methods to access information
                            about that date.</li>
                        <li>• Once you’ve created a Date object, setter methods can be used to change information about

                        <p>DOM is like a network of connected nodes that form a tree like structure. </p>
                        <img src="images/documentObjectModel.png" alt="object model">

                        <h2>Getting elements</h2>

                        <p>DOM allows us to see any element on a page. It will be either in a ode object, or node list.
                            It is not an array.
                            To make an array out of the list, use the method const imageArray =
                            Array.from(document.image); or spread operator
                            const imageArray = […document.images];</p>

                        <p>const h1 = document.getElementById('title');<br>
                            each id should have a different name.<br>

                            getElementsByTagName() will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag name
                            that is provided as an argument. For example, we can get all the list items (HTML tag of
                            ) in the document using this code:<br>
                            const listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');<br></p>

                        <h3>Get Elements By Their Class Name</h3>
                        <p>getElementsByClassName() will return a live node list of all elements that have the
                        class name that is supplied as an argument. For example, we can return a collection of
                        all elements with the class of 'hero' using the following code:</p>
                        <p>const heroes = document.getElementsByClassName('hero');</p><br>
                        <h3>Query Selectors</h3>
                        <p>The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find
                        thefirstelement in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an
                        argument. If no elements match, it will return null .
                        The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list
                        ofallthe elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements
                        match, it will return an empty node list.</p>

                    is contained inside the ul> element with the id of roster :</p>
                       <h6> heroes.innerHTML</h6>
                        <p>" li class=\"hero\">Superman
                            li class=\"vigilante hero\" id=\"bats\">Batman
                            li class=\"hero\">Wonder Woman
                            "</p><br>
                            <p>The innerHTML property is also writable and can be used to place a chunk of HTML inside an
                            element. This will replace all of a node’s children with the raw HTML contained in the
                            string. This saves you having to create a new text node as it’s done automatically and
                            inserted into the DOM. It’s also much quicker than using the standard DOM methods. For
                            example, the heading text that we changed before could be changed in one line:
                            h1.innerHTML = 'Suicide Squad';</p><br>
                           <p>The power of the innerHTML property becomes even more apparent if you want to insert a large
                            amount of HTML into the document. Instead of creating each element and text node
                            individually, you can simply enter the raw HTML as a string. The relevant nodes will then be
                            added to the DOM tree automatically. For example, we could change everything contained
                            within the <ul> element:</p> 
                                heroes.innerHTML = '<li>Harley Quinn</li>
                                <li>Deadshot</li>
                                <li>Killer Croc</li>
                                <li>Enchantress</li>
                                <li>Captain Boomerang</li>
                                <li>Katana</li>
                                <li>Slipknot</li>';
                               <p>This will now remove all the child elements of the <ul> element and replace them with
                                    the string of HTML that was provided, as shown in below.”</p> <br>

                                        Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes. • The
                                        document.getElementById() , document.getElementsByClassName() ,
                                        document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to
                                        access elements on a page. • The parentNode() , previousSibling() ,
                                        nextSibling() , childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate
                                        around the DOM tree. • An element’s attributes can be accessed using the
                                        getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method. • The
                                        createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic
                                        markup on the fly. • Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and
                                        insertBefore() methods. • Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild()
                                        method, and removed using the removeChild() method. • The innerHTML property can
                                        be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM. • The CSS properties of an
                                        element can be changed by accessing the style property. CHAPTER 7 EVENTS Event
                                        listeners check for an action, like an email coming in or a button click and
                                        then alert you or take action. “JavaScript, on the other hand, uses
                                        anon-blockingapproach that usesevent listenersto listen out for any clicks on
                                        the page. Every time the page is clicked, a callback function will be called. So
                                        the program can continue processing the rest of the code while it's waiting for
                                        the click event to happen. The following code can be used to attach an event
                                        listener to the document that fires when the user clicks anywhere on the page:”
                                        document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething); DO NOT use inline event
                                        handlers EVENT LISTENERS “The addEventListener() method is called on a node
                                        object, the node to which the event listener is being applied. For example, this
                                        code will attach an event listener to the document’s body:
                                        document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething); The addEventListener()
                                        method can also be called without a node, in which case it is applied to the
                                        global object, usually the whole browser window. Its first parameter is the type
                                        of event, and the second is a callback function that is invoked when the event
                                        occurs. There is also a third parameter that we'll cover later in the chapter.”

                                            There is also the dblclick event, which occurs when the user doubleclicks on
                                            the element to which the event listener is attached. To see an example of
                                            this, we’ll attach an event listener to the second paragraph in our example
                                            (with an ID of 'dblclick'). Add the following code to main.js :
                                            const dblclickParagraph = document.getElementById('dblclick');
                                            dblclickParagraph.addEventListener('dblclick', highlight);
                                            function highlight(event){
                                            event.target.classList.toggle('highlight');
                                            }
                                            KEYBOARD EVENTs
                                            1. The keydown event occurs when a key is pressed and willcontinue to
                                            occurif the key is held down.
                                            2. The keypress event occurs after a keydown event but before a keyup event.
                                            The keypress event only occurs for keys that produce character input (plus
                                            the 'Delete' key). This means that it’s the most reliable way to find out
                                            the character that was pressed on the keyboard.
                                            3. The keyup event occurs when a key is released.
                                            To understand the differences in these events, it is important to
                                            distinguish between a physicalkeyon the keyboard and acharacterthat appears
                                            on the screen. The keydown event is the action of pressing a key, whereas
                                            the keypress event is the action of a character being typed on the screen.</p>
