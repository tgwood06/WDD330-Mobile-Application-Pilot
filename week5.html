<h2>Ch 10 Testing and Debugging</h2>

<h3>FORMS  Sitepoint :”JavaScript: novice to ninja”</h3>
 
    <h4>Errors, Exceptions and Warnings</h4>
   <p>•	System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.<br>
    •	Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.<br>
    •	User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</p> <br>
   <p> Exceptions: error that allows the program to handle the error, sometimes with an error code<br>
    Stack Traces: a group or list of errors that help follow the trail to the error. <br>
    Warnings: code error that isn’t big enough to stop the program, but may cause it to run incorrectly<br>
    Testing and debugging are important during development because they need to happen in order to fix issues before production.<br>
</p>
    <h5>Strict Mode: operates code to find errors. Add ‘use strict’; to first line of code</h5><br>
   <h3> Debugging in the browser</h3>
   <h5>Use breakpoints to watch program run</h5> 
   <h5> Use alert() method to stop a program from running, ex alert(age); and will stop </h5> 
   <h5>  Debugging with the console: console.log() or console.trace()</h5> 
   <h5>  Debugging Tools;</h5> 
   <h5>  Use browsers</h5> 
   <h5>  Using keyword debugger before where you want it checked will show an error</h5> 
  <h3>  Error Objects</h3>
   <p> “•  EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.<br>
    •   RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.<br>
    •   ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.<br>
    •   SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.<br>
    •   TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.<br>
    •   URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.<br>
    •   InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.<br>
</p>
    <h3>“safe errors</h3>
  <p> 
    •	“The name property returns the name of the error constructor function used as a string, such as 'Error' or 'ReferenceError'.<br>
    •	The message property returns a description of the error and should be provided as an argument to the Error constructor function.<br>
    •	The stack property will return a stack trace for that error. This is a non-standard property and it’s recommended that it is not safe to use in production sites.”<br>
</p> 
   <h4> Try, catch, and finally: these will run code inside their block and then catch any errors</h4>

    <h4>Chapter 10 Summary</h4>
    <li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.</li>
    <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>
    <li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.
    <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.</li>
    <li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.</li>
    <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
    <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
    <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.</li>
    <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</li>
    <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>
