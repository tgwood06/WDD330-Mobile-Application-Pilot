<h2>Ch 8 Forms</h2>

<h3>FORMS  Sitepoint :”JavaScript: novice to ninja”</h3>
 <p>Example of a search submit button</p>
        <form name='search' action='/search'>
            <input name='searchInput'>
            <button type='submit'>Search</button>
        </form>
    <script src='main.js'></script>

    <h5>Some common types of form control are:</h5>
    <ul>
	 <li>input> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
	 <li>select> menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
	 <li>textarea> elements for longer text entry</li>
	 <li>button> elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
</ul>
<p>Using html toplace a value attribute: see value. Use inspect tool to see JS<br>
<label for='donation-amount'>Enter amount to donate:

    <h2>Chapter 8 Summary</h2>
    <ul>
<li>	Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>
<li>	Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>
<li>	HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.</li>
<li>	 document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>
<li>	 form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</li>
<li>	Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.</li>
<li>	Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.</li>
<li>	The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.</li>
<li>	The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h4>
    
    <p>three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
    <h3>Encapsulation:</h3>
    Encapsulation includes the idea that the data of an object should not be directly exposed. Instead, callers that want to achieve a given result are coaxed into proper usage by invoking methods (rather than accessing the data directly) https://www.intertech.com/Blog/encapsulation-in-javascript/
    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
    Polymorphism is one of the tenets of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the practice of designing objects to share behaviors and to be able to override shared behaviors with specific ones. Polymorphism takes advantage of inheritance in order to make this happen. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27642239/what-is-polymorphism-in-javascript
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    Taking what you have and adding to it, taking already existing objects and using them to inherit all properties and methods and then improve on functionality by adding new properties and methods.
    
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance">Inheritance</a></li>
</p>
    <h3>Constructor Functions</h3>
    Possible to create new objects using object literal notations
    Constructor function is an alternative

    Dice constructor function

    <br>
    <img src="images/instanceofdice.png" alt="method shorthand">

<h4>The Constructor Property</h4>
<p>All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it:<br>
const literalObject = {};<br>
<< {}<br>
literalObject.constructor<br>
<< [Function: Object]<br>

The constructor property allows us to use the object w/o declaring it directly<br>
const greenDice = new redDice.constructor(10);<br>
greenDice instanceOf Dice<br>
<< true</p><br>
<br>

<h3>Property Attributes and Descriptors</h3>
<p>We’ve already seen that all objects are collections of key-value paired properties. It turns out that each property has a number of attributes that provide information about the property. These attributes are stored in a property descriptor, which is an object that contains values of each attribute.
All object properties have the following attributes stored in a property descriptor:</p><br>
<ul>
<li> value ― This is the value of the property and is undefined by default</li>
<li>	 writable ― This boolean value shows whether a property can be changed or not, and is false by default</li>
<li>	 enumerable ― this boolean value shows whether a property will show up when the object is displayed in a for in loop, and is false by default</li>
<li>	 configurable ― this boolean value shows whether you can delete a property or change any of its attributes, and is false by default.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getters and Setters</h3>
<p>Get() and set() methods instead of a value attribute<br>
Objects can have one or the other, not both.<br>

Object.create(human); will use the original object Human and inherit all its properties. </p><br>


<h3>Modern JavaScript</h3>
<h4>Chapter 15 Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>	JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.</li>
<li>	Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.</li>
<li>	jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions.</li>
<li>	npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.</li>
<li>	A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
<li>	ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.</li>
<li>	The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.</li>
<li>	Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.</li>
<li>	React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.</li>
<li>	Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.</li>
<li>	Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.</li>
<li>	Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.</li>
<li>	Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing <</body>> tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.</li>
</ul>
