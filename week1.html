        <h2> Javascript</h2>
        <h3>Loops, Conditional Statements, Functions, Variables, Parameters, Arrays, Associative Arrays</h3>
        <p>>1. Functions and events: (p16 doing stuff)</p>
        <p>P17 “The grammar of the JavaScript language, called ‘the syntax’ by techies,
            declares that functions all have the same structure. They
            have a name, stuff that goes into the function, stuff that comes out
            of the function, and stuff that makes up what the function does.
            For a pork sausage factory function the structure would be
            <ul>
                <li>1. a name - makePorkSausages,</li>
                <li> 2. stuff that goes in - pigs,</li>
                <li> 3. stuff that comes out - pork sausages, and</li>
                <li> 4. stuff that makes up what the factory does - chopping, filling, and
                    a bunch of stuff no one really wants to know about.”</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>function theFunctionName(whatGoesIn)</h3>
        <h5>Functions are what allow JavaScript to be used on website to become interactive. </h5>
        <h5>2. Remembering User’s Info: (p35)</h5>
        <h5>saveStory function p 43</h5>
        <p> p 44 “When you want to get the user’s input from any input or text area
            tag, you use the special word ‘value.’ When you want to show
            something to a user, you use a section (see Section 1) and the special
            word ‘innerHTML.’ So...if your dealing with an input or textarea
            use value; a section, use innerHTML. Don’t get these mixed
            up. If you do, your code will run without an error but your page
            won’t get or display anything. Be careful. You’ll just have to remember
            which word to use in these two different situations, input
            or textarea use value and section uses innerHTML.”</p><br>

        <p>.value and innerHTMl at end of line will either get the info from input (.value) or show the user
            something
            (.innerHTML)
            KEY-VALUE PAIRS: The key idemtifies and the value is the info
            Example: key=Student name and value=grade,phone etc
            To get a story that is saved we use a “key”

            <h5> D. Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
                Syntax
                if (condition1) {
                // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true

        <p>p.54</p>
        <p> If something can be done some user or
            bunch of users will do it. If you and I don’t handle each situation
            our users can put us in then it will be us, not them, that look silly.
            Believe me, your life will be much simpler if you take care of as
            many of these situations as you can think of BEFORE you ship a
            product to your users.

        <p> “The toLocaleString function that converted the date
            and time stamp to a string already knows where you are and if it is
            daylight savings time or not.”</p>

            p.74</h4>
        <img src="images/json.png" alt="JSON">
        <p></p>P74 “JSON (Javascript Object Notation). Basically, if
        the string wasn’t created by some pre-written JSON code, a JSON
        library in techie speak, or by a person who knows the standard
        very well, JSON.parse can’t understand the string and will fail.
        This means you have to be very careful if you are typing in the
        strings yourself. Thankfully, in JavaScript the JSON library has a
        way to create those strings for you. You’ll see how to do that when
        you get to line 21.”</p><br>

        <p> Adding *1 = p96 * 1’. “If you multiply
            the text the user enters by the number 1, JavaScript will convert
            the text to a number! That’s nice. I’ve seen a lot of other languages
            where it was a lot harder than that.”</p><br>

        <h3> REWIRING YOUR BRAIN VIDEOS SITEPOINT</h3>
        <p> In the videos about rewiring our brain, I think I have already done most of what was mentioned, and I
            believe most people nowadays know mobile devices aren’t going anywhere. Start Small and scale up, keep it
            simple. Design UX with users needs, keep in mind ease of use and easy to reach areas on a screen,
            “reachability” use an href to make a number into a way to call from the page, no more copy and paste
            numbers, reduce and optimize data and images. Overall I understand it is all about ease and usage designs.
